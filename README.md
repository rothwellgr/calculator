# Calculator

As per The Odin Project > Project: Calculator. I've seen the hobby of vintage calculator collecting, from a distance respectfully, so I've adapted this project thus. If you're into vintage calculator collecting, you might notice it looks somewhat like Texas Instrument's TI-1205. I do like the design of the TI-1205 - basic operators separated vertically from the rest of the buttons.
